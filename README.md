## Overview :
Java-Clock is a project of an *Analog Clock*. This clock has transparent backgound (or we can say transparent `JFrame`), which is achieved with `setUndecorated` and `setOpaque` methods set to the `JFrame` and its component. Moreover a new title bar is created with a responsive close `JButton`.
All these will help new `Java` learner to make a custom `JFrame`.
